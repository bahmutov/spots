**spots** makes it simple to bind some arguments, leaving the rest free.

```js
var S = require('spots');
function sub(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}
// use library itself as a placeholder
var minus1 = S(sub, S, 1);
// minus1 = sub(_, 1) function
minus1(9); // 8, same as sub(9, 1);
```

It can apply more than 1 argument.

```js
function add4(a, b, c, d) { return a + b + c + d; }
var applyEven = S(add4, S, 1, S, 2);
applyEven(-1, -2); // 0
// equivalent to add4(-1, 1, -2, 2);
```

It works very nice to solve [JavaScript Madness][madness] problem.

```js
['1', '2', '3'].map(S(parseInt, S, 10));
// returns [1, 2, 3]
```

You can use **spots** with [functional-pipeline][fp] to apply some arguments *across all functions*.

```js
var fp = require('functional-pipeline');
function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
function sub(a, b) { return a - b; }
fp(
  S(sub, 1, S),
  S(add, S, 20)
)(3); // 18
// same as
// add( sub(1, 3), 20 )
```
